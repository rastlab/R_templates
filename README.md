R templates for a lot of basic (read: typical) social psychology data analyses. 
Walks the user through importing data, cleaning data, running psychometric analyses, 
then finally analyzing the data using ANOVA or regression with appropriate interaction probing techniques.

Templates are numbered sequentially, but are only meant to assist the user through analyses in a logical and structured manner.
The sequential order does not imply the user to go through each template in sequence, again these are starting blocks for users.
For instance, if one's data are already 'tidy' then skip the '00_dataset_prep_and_cleaning.R' script. 

I've tried to automate as much as possible to keep user errors to a minimum. 
I've also tried to keep as much as possible of the data output in R.
For instace, figures and tables are created in APA format then automatically saved to your PC!

I also commented throughout each script to help new users along where possible or to explain what a command does.
As a side aim, I wrote these templates to help guide new R users through the stages of data analyses, 
especially those coming from SPSS.
Many comments are specifically for new users and peolpe switching from SPSS.


NB: although I wrote these scripts, sections or entire parts might be modified from existing code posted online 
(e.g., Stackoverflow, R blogs) or based on feedback/workshops from colleagues (e.g., Chris Aberson).
I tried to cite these online sources where applicable by providing the link to the source material.

I'm constantly cleaning the code and adding new templates as I run new analyses or find new packages to simplify the analyses/code.

If you have a template you want to add, feel free to send it to me. 
If I want to add it after reviewing/testing it, I will put it into my desired format then upload it and attribute it to you.
